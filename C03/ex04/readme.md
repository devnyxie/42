Explanation Using the Example
## Initialization

The function starts by checking if `to_find` is an empty string (`if (*to_find == '\0')`). If it is, it returns `str` immediately. For our example, `to_find` is "world", so we proceed to the main loop.

## Outer Loop (while (*str))

The outer loop iterates over each character in `str`. On the first iteration, `str` points to 'H' in "Hello, world!".

## Setting Pointers

Inside the outer loop, `str_ptr` is set to point to the current character of `str` (initially 'H'). `find_ptr` is set to point to the first character of `to_find` (initially 'w'). `match_start` is set to the current position of `str` for later use if a match is found.

## Inner Loop (while (*str_ptr && *find_ptr && *str_ptr == *find_ptr))

The inner loop compares characters pointed to by `str_ptr` and `find_ptr`. In the first iteration, `str_ptr` is 'H' and `find_ptr` is 'w'. Since they are not equal, the inner loop does not execute.

## Moving to Next Character

Since there was no match, the outer loop increments `str` to point to the next character (now pointing to 'e'), and the process repeats. The comparisons continue with `str` pointing to 'e', then 'l', then 'l', and finally ','. None of these characters match the first character of `to_find`.

## Finding the Match

Eventually, `str` points to ' ' (space) and then to 'w'. At this point:
- `str_ptr` points to 'w' in `str` and `find_ptr` points to 'w' in `to_find`.
- They match, so both pointers increment.

The inner loop continues comparing characters:
- 'o' (in `str`) matches 'o' (in `to_find`).
- 'r' matches 'r'.
- 'l' matches 'l'.
- Finally, 'd' matches 'd'.

When `find_ptr` reaches the null terminator `'\0'` after the last match, it indicates that all characters in `to_find` have been matched successfully.

## Returning the Match

Since the inner loop has matched all characters in `to_find`, the function returns `match_start`, which points to the starting position of the substring "world" in the original `str`.
